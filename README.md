> Making a name for yourself with tea

This notebook has one simple function: make a name out of a type of tea.

Inspired by [Greentea Peng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greentea_Peng), I thought it'd be fun to randomise some teas and synonyms for words meaning "attractive" and invent a new R&B artist name.

## Try it with uv (without installing)

```bash
uvx --with git+https://github.com/starchildluke/greentea-pengerator greentea-pengerator
```

## How to use

Click the Boil the kettle button below to generate a new name.
